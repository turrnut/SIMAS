**SIMAS**, which is an acronym for **SIM**ple **AS**sembly, is a dynamically typed, compiled,
high level, procedural programming language with a syntax that is inspired by the Assembly programming language.<br>
Initially I wrote SIMAS as a simple toy language in the span of three days, but I keep adding features to it so it became what it is today.<br>

SIMAS is a general purpose programming language, but is used more in web development. <br>

> [!NOTE]
> This is the original SIMASJS implementation of the language. If you're interested, check out the [other implementations](https://github.com/turrnutorg/SIMAS) too!<br>

## Why SIMAS?
- **Simplicity:** With a minimalistic and Assembly-like syntax, SIMAS allows you to write code with an instruction format that makes behavior predictable and transparent.

- **Web Ready:** In this SIMASJS implementation, web functionalities are provided out-of-the-box, because you can host static websites and even develop full-stack MVC web applications with a minimalistic codebase.

- **Feature rich:** Includes list manipulation, file I/O, function and control flow support, and much more â€” all in a compact, instructional style.

## Quickstart
